### A Full Stack MLOPs Project

This repository demonstrates the design, implementation, training, deployment and monitoring of an ML batch system using MLOps best practices.
In this project, I built a production-ready model forecasting energy connsumption levels in 24-hour time intervas across multple cosumer types from Denmark.

Also, the project demonstrates integrating an experiment tracker, model registry, a feature store (Hopsworks), Docker, Airflow and Github Actions.
Below is the proposed pipeline architecture:
